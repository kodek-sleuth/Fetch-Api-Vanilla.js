lorem50This extension adds a 
resized_img_src() function (and others) 
to the template context, which creates a URL to dynamically 
resize an image. This function takes either a 
path to a local image (either absolute, or relative to the IMAGES_PATH) o
r an URL to a remote image, and returns a URL 
that will serve a resized version on demand.
